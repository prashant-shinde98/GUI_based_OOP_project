# GUI-Based NLP Application

## Description

This project is a fully functional GUI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The application offers a user-friendly interface for performing various NLP tasks, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and text summarization. Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles, with all login information securely stored in a `data.json` file.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Intuitive and user-friendly design for seamless interaction.
- **User Authentication**: Create an account, log in, and log out.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract and classify named entities from the text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the input text.
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of lengthy texts.
- **Persistent Login Information**: Save user credentials and profiles in a `data.json` file for easy access.
